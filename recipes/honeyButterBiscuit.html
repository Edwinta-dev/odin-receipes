            Ingredients for the Honey Butter Biscuits Recipe
        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour. </strong>Bleached or unbleached all-purpose flour both work just fine.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar. </strong>White table sugar like you mix into your tea.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Powder. </strong>Fresh baking powder is a must for making homemade biscuits. Find out if your baking powder is fresh using the instructions in my Baking Basics Guide.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt. </strong>Kosher table salt or fine sea salt are my favorites.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream of Tartar. </strong>Acts as a leavening agent in baked goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter. </strong>I use real unsalted butter. If you use salted butter eliminate the additional salt called for in this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk.</strong> We get the best results with the full-fat version gives our biscuits flavor and a nicely moist spring.</li>
        </ol>
