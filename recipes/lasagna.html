            This classic lasagna recipe features layers of savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and tender lasagna noodles,
            all topped with a generous layer of melted cheese. The rich meat sauce, simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and 
            Italian herbs, provides a hearty base. A smooth béchamel sauce adds a luscious, creamy texture that complements 
            the robust flavors of the meat. Alternating layers of sauce, pasta, and a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan 
            cheeses create a beautifully structured dish. Baked until golden and bubbly, this lasagna is a comforting, 
            indulgent meal perfect for family dinners or special occasions.

            How Long to Cook Lasagna
        </h4>
        <p>
            The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. 
            Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. 
            Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you 
            cut into it.
