        This classic lasagna recipe features layers of savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and tender lasagna noodles,
        all topped with a generous layer of melted cheese. The rich meat sauce, simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and 
        Italian herbs, provides a hearty base. A smooth béchamel sauce adds a luscious, creamy texture that complements 
        the robust flavors of the meat. Alternating layers of sauce, pasta, and a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan 
        cheeses create a beautifully structured dish. Baked until golden and bubbly, this lasagna is a comforting, 
        indulgent meal perfect for family dinners or special occasions.
